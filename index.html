                <p>I started my journey as a web developer when I was 18 years old. I had just graduated from high school and was looking for a career path that would suit my interests and skills. I decided to enroll in a web development course at a local community college. It was a two-year program that covered the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. I learned how to create static and dynamic websites, how to use frameworks and libraries, and how to work with databases and APIs. I enjoyed the course and learned a lot, but I also realized that there was so much more to learn. The web development field is constantly evolving and changing, and there are always new tools and technologies to master.<p/>
